 * THE INTERVIEW CHALLENGE: The High-Speed Color Synthesis Engine
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Scenario:
 * You are building a display driver for a 1GHz high-definition lighting array. 
 * Each pixel is an RGB LED, requiring three synchronized 64-bit PWM channels.
 *
 * Technical Specifications:
 * 1. Vector Comparison: Each LED index requires three 64-bit comparisons 
 * (Red, Green, Blue) per cycle.
 * 2. Throughput: The system must run at a 1GHz clock frequency.
 * 3. Resolution: Full 64-bit duty cycle control for millions of color shades.
 *
 * Hardware Constraints (Senior Architect Review):
 * - Pipelined Datapath: Because 64-bit comparison cannot be completed in 
 * 1ns, you must implement a multi-stage pipeline for the RGB comparison.
 * - Synchronization: Ensure the Red, Green, and Blue "Turn-ON" events are 
 * perfectly aligned to prevent color-fringe artifacts.
 *
 * 🌟 EXTRA CREDIT: "The Gamma Correction Pipeline"
 * Insert a lookup table (LUT) stage into the pipeline to map 8-bit color 
 * inputs to 64-bit PWM targets before the comparison occurs.
