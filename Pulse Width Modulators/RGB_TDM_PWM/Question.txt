 * THE INTERVIEW CHALLENGE: The "True Color" Spectrum Controller
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Scenario:
 * A single-color LED is no longer enough. You are designing a premium lighting 
 * controller for 16 RGB LEDs. You must now synthesize specific colors by 
 * independently controlling the Red, Green, and Blue duty cycles for every pixel.
 *
 * Technical Specifications:
 * 1. Vector Processing: Manage 48 total 1-bit outputs (16 LEDs x 3 colors).
 * 2. Color Mapping: The Context RAM must now store a "Color Vector" per LED.
 * 3. Synchronization: The R, G, and B components of a single LED must stay 
 * synchronized in their breathing phase to prevent "color shifting."
 *
 * Hardware Constraints (Senior Architect Review):
 * - Memory Bandwidth: Optimize the Context RAM bit-width to handle the 
 * tripled data requirement (3x Fibonacci states per LED index).
 * - Datapath Efficiency: Reuse the "Shared Adder" to process R, G, and B 
 * components sequentially or via a wider parallel datapath.
 *
 * 🌟 EXTRA CREDIT: "The Gamut Master"
 * Implement a "Global Brightness" multiplier. Even while the LEDs are 
 * breathing through the Fibonacci sequence, allow a top-level signal to 
 * dim the entire 48-output array simultaneously without corrupting the math.
