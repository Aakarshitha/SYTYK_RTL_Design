 * CASE STUDY: Timing Closure at 1GHz (STA & Pipelining)
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Scenario:
 * The design is being ported to a high-precision laser driver.
 * - Clock Frequency: 1.0 GHz (Tclk = 1ns)
 * - Counter Width: 64 bits
 * * The Problem:
 * During Static Timing Analysis (STA), the 64-bit magnitude comparator 
 * (count_q == target) fails setup timing. The carry-propagation and 
 * comparison logic is too deep to finish within 1ns.
 *
 * Design Challenge:
 * 1. Pipelining: Architect a multi-stage pipelined comparator that breaks 
 * the 64-bit check into 16-bit "chunks."
 * 2. Latency Compensation: The 'match' signal now arrives 3 cycles late.
 * How do you adjust the RTL so the laser pulse width is still exactly N?
