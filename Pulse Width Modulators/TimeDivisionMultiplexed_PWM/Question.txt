 * THE INTERVIEW CHALLENGE: The Massively Scalable "Alive" LED Array
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Scenario:
 * Your IoT chip has been upgraded to a smart-hub that drives 16 independent 
 * status LEDs. Each LED must maintain its own unique Fibonacci "breathing" 
 * sequence, making the entire panel look like a living organism.
 *
 * Technical Specifications:
 * 1. Multi-Channel: Drive 16 independent LED outputs (pwm_bus[15:0]).
 * 2. Independence: Each LED tracks its own N-value and Fibonacci progression.
 * 3. Scaling: The architecture must be "O(1) Logic"—increasing the number 
 * of LEDs should not increase the number of adders or comparators.
 *
 * Hardware Constraints (Senior Architect Review):
 * - Resource Sharing: You are forbidden from instantiating 16 separate modules. 
 * Use Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) with a single "Shared Engine."
 * - Context Switching: Implement a "Context RAM" to store {state, count, fib_curr, 
 * fib_prev} for each LED index.
 * - Throughput: The system must cycle through all 16 LEDs in a round-robin 
 * scheduler at 1GHz, updating one LED "context" per clock cycle.
 *
 * 🌟 EXTRA CREDIT: "The Invisible Handover"
 * Ensure the output pins do not flicker. Implement a 1-bit output register bank 
 * (demux) that "holds" the PWM state for each LED while the shared engine 
 * is busy calculating the other 15 channels.
