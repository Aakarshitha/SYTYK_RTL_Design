 * Module: tdm_pwm_64bit

 * THE INTERVIEW CHALLENGE: The Area-Constrained 16-Channel Controller
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Scenario:
 * You are designing a high-precision motor controller for a 16-axis robotic arm. 
 * Each axis requires a dedicated 64-bit PWM signal for ultra-fine resolution.
 *
 * Technical Specifications:
 * 1. Resolution: 64-bit counter per channel.
 * 2. Scaling: Drive 16 independent PWM outputs (pwm_bus[15:0]).
 * 3. Area Constraint: The silicon budget does not allow for sixteen 64-bit 
 * comparators. You must use a single "Shared Engine."
 *
 * Hardware Constraints (Senior Architect Review):
 * - Time Division Multiplexing (TDM): Use a single high-speed 64-bit adder/comparator.
 * - Context Management: Implement a Context RAM to store the 64-bit 'count' 
 * and 'target' for each of the 16 channels.
 * - Throughput: The system must "visit" and update one channel per clock cycle.
 *
 * 🌟 EXTRA CREDIT: "Zero-Latency Handover"
 * Ensure that when the TDM engine updates channel N, the output registers 
 * for channels 0-15 maintain their current state without glitches or 
 * "sampling drops."
