 * CASE STUDY: Area Optimization & Glitch Robustness
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Scenario:
 * The die area is over budget. We need to reduce gate count while fixing 
 * functional "mid-pulse glitches" reported by the verification team.
 *
 * Design Challenge:
 * 1. Down-Counter Migration: Replace the Up-Counter/Comparator with a 
 * Down-Counter to Zero. 
 * Why? A "Zero-Detector" (NOR-reduction) is physically smaller and faster 
 * than a Magnitude Comparator.
 *
 * 2. The Shadow Register: Implement a "Shadow" or "Pre-load" register for N.
 * Ensure that if a CPU updates the brightness, the change only takes 
 * effect at the start of the next PWM frame to prevent pulse truncation.
 *
 * 3. TDM Architecture (Conceptual):
 * If we need to drive 16 LEDs, how can we use ONE 64-bit ALU and a 
 * distributed RAM instead of 16 separate counters?
