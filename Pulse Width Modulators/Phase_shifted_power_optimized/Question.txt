 * THE INTERVIEW CHALLENGE: Peak Current Mitigation in 64-bit PWM
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Scenario:
 * Your 16-channel 64-bit PWM is causing massive voltage droops on the power 
 * rail. This occurs because all 16 channels switch HIGH simultaneously 
 * when their respective counters reset to zero.
 *
 * Technical Specifications:
 * 1. Current Spreading: Implement Phase Division Multiplexing to stagger 
 * the start times of all 16 channels.
 * 2. Math Integrity: Even with a phase offset, each channel must maintain 
 * exactly the HIGH time specified by its 64-bit target.
 * 3. 1GHz Timing: The phase-comparison logic must also be pipelined to 
 * maintain the 1GHz target frequency.
 *
 * Hardware Constraints (Senior Architect Review):
 * - Phase Offsets: Store a 64-bit "Start-Time Offset" in the Context RAM 
 * for each channel.
 * - EMI Reduction: Demonstrate how phase-shifting reduces the fundamental 
 * frequency energy of the switching noise.
 *
 * 🌟 EXTRA CREDIT: "The Interleaved Reset"
 * Design the system so that the counter resets are also staggered, ensuring 
 * that no two 64-bit counters increment or clear on the same clock cycle.
