 * THE INTERVIEW CHALLENGE: The "Green Power" High-Current Controller
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Scenario:
 * Your 16-LED array is drawing too much instantaneous current. When all 16 
 * channels switch HIGH at the start of a cycle (N=0), the power rail sags, 
 * causing "Ground Bounce" and electromagnetic interference (EMI).
 *
 * Technical Specifications:
 * 1. Peak Current Reduction: Stagger the "Turn-ON" time of each LED so they 
 * never switch simultaneously.
 * 2. Phase Distribution: If the PWM period is T, LED(i) should ideally 
 * trigger at offset (T/16)*i.
 * 3. Integrity: The total HIGH time (duty cycle) must remain mathematically 
 * perfect according to the Fibonacci sequence, regardless of the start delay.
 *
 * Hardware Constraints (Senior Architect Review):
 * - Phase-Division Multiplexing (PDM): Add a "Phase Offset" field to the 
 * Context RAM for each LED.
 * - Logic Depth: The "Start Trigger" must now compare the counter against 
 * a unique offset rather than a global zero.
 *
 * 🌟 EXTRA CREDIT: "The Spectrum Spreader"
 * Dynamically randomize the phase offsets on every reset. This spreads the 
 * switching noise across a wider frequency spectrum (Spread Spectrum PWM), 
 * making it much easier for the device to pass FCC/EMI certification.
