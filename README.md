# SYTYK_RTL_Design
So You Think You Know RTL Design 


This Repository contains a set of RTL designs plus codes either in Verilog or in System Verilog, that are tricky/challenging and excite any engineer that sees them.

Most codes and their questions will be authored by me, what I learnt, what I came across studying and industry, and a version/modification of what I saw in interviews etc.

For others, will do my best to credit the right authors of the codes or the questions as well.

Hope all who see it enjoy it!


Happy RTL designing!
